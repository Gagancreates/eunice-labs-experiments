The right side is \\(\\frac{3}{1+abc}\\), which is symmetric in \\(a, b, c\\). Since the equality case is when all variables are 1, maybe substituting \\(a = b = c = 1\\) gives both sides equal to \\(3/(1+1) = 1.5\\), and the left side becomes \\(1/(1*(1+1))\\) three times, which is \\(0.5*3 = 1.5\\)\n"

      "Okay, let's see. Kiyana has 24 grapes, and she gives half of them to her friend. The question is asking how many grapes she gives away. Hmm. So first, I need to figure out what half of 24 is. Half means dividing by 2, right? So if you split 24 into two equal parts, each part would be half. Let me double-check that. 24 divided by 2 equals 12. Yeah, because 12 times 2 is 24. So if she gives half away, that's 12 grapes. Wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication. Half is the same as multiplying by 1/2. So 24 times 1/2. That would also be 12. Yep, that checks out. I don't think there's any trick here, just a straightforward division problem. So the answer should be 12 grapes.\n",
